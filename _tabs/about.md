## About me

My name is Christopher Jelly, I am a lifelong learner, knowledge worker, husband, amateur piano player, and I think, a reasonable human being.

I am currently working as an Information Technology Senior Associate at Spaulding Ridge, working on analytics, some ETL processes, and a variety of system administrator duties sprinkled in there.

I find that writing out my thoughts and experiences helps me think through whichever topic I am exploring this week, and this blog gives me a chance to do so in a more structured manner. While this is primarily for me,
I hope that others find something useful (or at least entertaining) in the journey.


## What to Expect

- *Technical deep-dives* on the tools or concepts I am learning (devops, Kubernetes, data pipelines)
- *Project overviews* from what I have been building recently
- *Learning reflections* on everything from Kubernetes to piano technique
