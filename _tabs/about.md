## About me

My name is Christopher Jelly, I am a lifelong learner, knowledge worker, husband, amateur piano player, and I think, a reasonable human being.

I am currently working as an Information Technology Senior Associate at Spaulding Ridge, working on analytics, some ETL processes, and a variety of system administrator duties sprinkled in there.

I am finding that writing out my thoughts and experiences helps me think through whichever topic I am exploring this week, so while this blog is primarily for me, I hope that others find something useful in the journey.


## What to Expect

- *Technical deep-dives* on Kubernetes, Devops, or whatever topic I am into that day
- *Project overviews* from what I have been building
- *Learning reflections* on everything from Kuberentes to piano technique
